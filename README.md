Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing, building, testing, and maintaining computer programs.
It important to make sure that end product requirements are meet and at high quility

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-The Software Crisis and the Rise of Structured Programming(1960s-1970s): Projects were raning over budget, delivered late and failed to meet user needs
-The Object-Oriented Programming Revolution(1980s-1990s): Object-oriented programming introduced a new way of software development, focusing on objects.
-The Agile Manifesto and the Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001-Present): changing the way we coordinated software projects to be more flexible.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: This phase involves gathering requirements, defining the scope of the project, and creating a detailed plan for the development process.
2. Analysis: In this phase we analyzes the requirements and designs the system structure, also identify the functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Design: This phase focuses on translating the requirements and system architecture into a detailed design specification. It includes designing the user interface, database schema, and software components.
4. Implementation: This is the coding phase, where the actual code based on the design specifications is done. Using programming languages, frameworks, and tools to build the software.
5. Testing: This phase involves testing the software to identify and fix defects. It includes various testing methods, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, to ensure the software meets the requirements and quality standards.
6. Deployment: Once the software is tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment.
7. Maintenance: This ongoing phase involves maintaining and updating the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall excels in scenarios like large-Scale construction project. Like the software for a complex infrastructure project, such as a new airport terminal.
Agile thrives in scenarios like startup product development. Like a startup building a new mobile app and wants to quickly get a minimum viable product (MVP) to market to gather user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Developer
Role: Responsible for designing, coding, testing, and documenting software applications.
Responsibilities:
    * Translating software requirements into functional code.
    * Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
    * Debugging and fixing software defects.
    * Collaborating with other developers and team members.
    * Keeping up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer:
Role: Responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of software applications.
Responsibilities:
    * Developing and executing test plans.
    * Identifying and reporting software defects.
    * Verifying bug fixes and software updates.
    * Collaborating with developers to improve software quality.
    * Ensuring software meets quality standards and user expectations.
3. Project Manager:
Role: Responsible for planning, executing, and monitoring software development projects.
Responsibilities:
    * Defining project scope, goals, and deliverables.
    * Creating and managing project schedules and budgets.
    * Leading and motivating the project team.
    * Communicating project status to stakeholders.
    * Identifying and mitigating project risks.
    * Ensuring projects are completed on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
* IDEs are software applications that provide a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. important for convinience and increased efficiency. eg VS code, IntelliJ IDEA, android studio etc
* VCS are tools that track changes to code and other project files, enabling developers to collaborate on projects, revert to previous versions, and manage different versions of their software.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
